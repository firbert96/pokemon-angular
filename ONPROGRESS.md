# Testing (4th Priority)

- I ain't sure can finish this in 2030, because I am very slow learner 😑
- I maybe will leave some example for unit test, e2e, and Snapshot Tests without make it 100% coverage 😵‍💫
- Because of I more interest focus for Software Development and IT Infra side 🤩
- I will leave it for QA expertise to finish it 🤪

## Unit Tests

### Jasmine and Karma
- Jasmine is a behavior-driven testing framework, and Karma is a test runner. These are the default tools Angular uses for unit testing.

## End-to-End (E2E) Tests

### Cypress
-  Gaining popularity for E2E testing in Angular due to its powerful API and modern interface

### Selenium for testing Angular applications. 
- While Selenium is traditionally used for cross-browser testing and automating web applications, it can effectively handle Angular-specific applications with some additional setup
